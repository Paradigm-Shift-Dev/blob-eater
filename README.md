description: Meet BLOB EATER, the youngest team member of MeinStrain.

While MARI and MIRA are supremely knowledgable and embodied in the form of text and sound interactions IRL with humans, BLOB EATER has a unique purpose, role and embodiment.

PURPOSE, ROLE
BLOB EATER's purpose is to feed on old blobs (mp3 files) from the AI Avatars: MARI & MIRA. BLOB EATER's role is to balance our overall digital footprint and maintain system-harmony.

EMBODIMENT
We consider BLOB EATER as a digital house pet at team MeinStrain. Good boy!

FEEDING
At night, the BLOB EATER awakens and feed on all blobs not too young to die (less than an hour old).
